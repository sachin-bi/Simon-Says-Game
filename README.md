**Simon Says Game**

**A Classic Memory Challenge in JavaScript**

This repository contains the code for a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Says game. Players test their memory and reaction skills by following a sequence of colored buttons that light up in a specific order. The game progressively adds more colors to the sequence as the player successfully repeats them.

**Features:**

* **Intuitive Gameplay:** Mimic the color sequence displayed by the game.
* **Increasing Difficulty:** The game gets faster and adds more colors as you progress.
* **High Score Tracking:** Keep track of your best performance and challenge yourself to improve.
* **Visual Feedback:** Buttons flash to indicate the correct color sequence.
* **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Play on any device with a web browser.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.**
3. **Press `Enter` to start the game.**

**How to Play:**

* Press any key or click "Start" to begin.
* The game will display a sequence of colored buttons by flashing them one at a time.
* After the sequence is complete, it's your turn to repeat it by clicking the buttons in the same order.
* Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, the game adds an additional color and increases the speed slightly.
* If you click the wrong color or miss a click, the game ends and your score is displayed.

**Technical Details:**
